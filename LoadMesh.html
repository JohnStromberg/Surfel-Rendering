    <p>This is a very simplified mesh loading example.  We're using a stripped down mesh format based on the PLY format.
    The assumption is that the file starts with two integers, the number of vertices and the number of triangles. Next comes
    a list of xyz coordinates for each vertex, and then a list of vertex indices for each triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
    A real PLY file would have a header describing the attributes contained in the file, and would probably have more
    than just position information for each vertex.
    </p>
    <p>
    This code is not terribly robust and will not handle poorly formed files well.

<div> Select mesh file:
    <input type = "file" id="fileInput">

<canvas id = "gl-canvas" width="1280" height="768">
    Sorry; you web browser doesn't support HTML5's canvas element.
