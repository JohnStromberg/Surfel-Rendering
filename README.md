# About
This project takes two point clouds and renders them using surfels. The two datasets were created using the Scaniverse app on my phone. The project was built in WebGL

# Credits
This project was made by John Stromberg.

The following citations are the resources I used on this project. I used the first two papers cited as general guides to this project. They were able to answer most of my questions on how to implement this. The third source is the information on the rotation matrix I used. The specific equation I used was equation 9.63 on page 257. The fourth citation is the source where I got information about Gaussian filters.
